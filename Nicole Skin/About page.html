I created Nicole Skin to give my fans access to the makeup products that I love and use every single day to create my looks. Whether Iâ€™m getting my makeup done with my glam team for a shoot, or doing my own makeup at home, I love that makeup can make you feel confident and beautiful and I want to share that feeling with you guys.

My new, updated line features all of my favorite iconic Lip Kit shades and my must-haves, including blushes, bronzers, highlighters, high glosses, matte liquid lipsticks, lip blushes, and brow essentials eyeliners. Everything is clean, vegan, and with ingredients that are good for your skin, but I made sure we didnâ€™t sacrifice quality, pigmentation or performance. For me, being able to have a lasting matte lip formula that wasnâ€™t overly drying, was so important when reformulating my Lip Kit. My new formula has 8-hour wear and lasting colour but is super comfortable on the lips. Iâ€™m obsessed with it, and I know you guys are going to love it too.

And this is just the start! Iâ€™m working on some amazing new launches that I canâ€™t wait to share with you.

xo, Nicole ðŸ’•
